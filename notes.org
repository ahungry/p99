* DONE Substance problem
Running any of the seesaw updates in clojure threads triggers a
"component creation on non-main thread" type error event from
substance.

I don't think its worth the complication of including that package for
the sake of some fancier GUI styles, at the expense of the extra
complexity, as seesaw tends to look "good enough" (even if a bit swing
like).

* DONE Need to optimize for the parsing
Currently the full file read can be excruciatingly slow when a file is
14e6 lines.  A 10 to 20 times speedup is possible by using the
logs/get-lines-of-newest-file parsing (holds cursor position at end).

However, we can probably get this to be even faster if we use the
event stuff to push an event (like we do auction) when particular
lines are found.

This was done, it is looking pretty good.
