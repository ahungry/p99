* Substance problem
Running any of the seesaw updates in clojure threads triggers a
"component creation on non-main thread" type error event from
substance.

I don't think its worth the complication of including that package for
the sake of some fancier GUI styles, at the expense of the extra
complexity, as seesaw tends to look "good enough" (even if a bit swing
like).
